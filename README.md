# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store & Google Play Markets
The goal of this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what types of apps are likely to attract more users. The analysis is performed using Jupyter notebook. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains information about various apps on the App Store and Google Play markets. The data is cleaned and processed to extract relevant information such as app genre, pricing, and ratings. The results of the analysis are then used to identify patterns and trends that can be used to inform app development decisions.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have Jupyter notebook installed on your machine. You can download Jupyter notebook [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

You will also need to download the dataset for this project. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) for Google Play market and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) for App Store market.

Once you have Jupyter notebook and the dataset, you can open the notebook Apps Analysis.ipynb and run the code to replicate the analysis.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the data, the project aims to help developers identify the types of apps that are likely to be successful in the App Store and Google Play markets. The results of the analysis can be used to inform app development decisions, such as the choice of app genre, pricing, and features.
